## This culminating project is so cooked
instead of working on the geometry work, which I admittidley should have done, I instead ended up not doing a single thing after like the second assignment for this entire unit.. and now I'm on a sunday night to hurridly fix up a game for the end of year culmination for the unit that was due two days ago..
